# KleeneStar - WebServer for Scalable, Plugin-Based Issue Applications

**KleeneStar** (/ˈkleɪni stɑːr/) is the central runtime and integration layer of the **KleeneStar** system. It hosts the core web server and binds all relevant modules into a unified, extensible platform, serving as the main entry point for development, deployment, and collaboration.

Whether you're building a local knowledge base, an issue tracker, or a distributed collaboration platform, **KleeneStar** provides the foundation for scalable, privacy, conscious applications, with full control over infrastructure and semantics.

# Quick Install

The quickest way to get **KleeneStar** up and running - including all required sibling repositories and the **WebExpress** framework packages - is the quick install script. It clones or updates the full workspace, restores the NuGet dependencies (including the **WebExpress** libraries), builds the server and starts it via `dotnet run`.

Prerequisites: [git](https://git-scm.com) and the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dot.net/download).

## Linux, macOS, WSL2, Termux

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kleenestar-project/KleeneStar/develop/install.sh | bash
```

## Windows (native, PowerShell)

Heads up: Native Windows runs **KleeneStar** without WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - the **WebExpress**-based web server and all plugins work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file an issue](https://github.com/kleenestar-project/KleeneStar/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kleenestar-project/KleeneStar/develop/install.ps1)
```

The script prepares the following layout next to each other and launches the server afterwards:

```
KleeneStar/
├── KleeneStar/           (main repository - the web server you start)
├── KleeneStar.Core/
├── KleeneStar.Model/
├── KleeneStar.Portal/
└── KleeneStar.Templates/
```

Once the script finishes, **KleeneStar** is running and accessible at [http://localhost/kleenestar](http://localhost/kleenestar). To restart it later:

```
cd KleeneStar/KleeneStar/src/KleeneStar
dotnet run
```

Optional environment variables to customize the installation:

| Variable             | Description                                        | Default      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `KLEENESTAR_DIR`     | Installation directory                             | `KleeneStar` |
| `KLEENESTAR_BRANCH`  | Branch checked out for all repositories            | `develop`    |
| `KLEENESTAR_NO_RUN`  | Set to `1` to only build and skip starting the app | (unset)      |

## Demo accounts

A fresh installation is seeded with demo data, including four accounts. All of them sign in with the password **`kleenestar`** (user name or e-mail address):

| User name        | E-mail                          | Group       |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `admin`          | `admin@kleenestar.org`          | Admin       |
| `alice.engineer` | `alice.engineer@kleenestar.org` | Engineering |
| `marketing.user` | `marketer@kleenestar.org`       | Marketing   |
| `support.user`   | `support@kleenestar.org`        | Support     |

The demo password is published with the source. An installation that keeps these accounts beyond a demonstration must give them passwords of their own: the owner changes it under *Profile → Security*, or an administrator creates a one-time password link in the identity settings.
